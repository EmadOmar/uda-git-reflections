When would you want to use a remote repository
  rather than keeping all your work local?
* When I'm working on a project with someone else, or with a team
* When I want to have an online backup of my project
* When I want to share the source of my project with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
  Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* Because I might haven't completed the work on a fix or a feature,
  which might make the project broke and others won't be able to launch it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
  When would you use one instead of another?
* Forks are GitHub clones that have a reference to the cloned repository
* Clones a copy of a repository with its Git history
* Branches are like labels to commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of
  the remote stored locally?
* This enables us to know the sync status of the local and remote branch if
  we ran offline. And also could allow us to merge offline too.
