When would you want to use a remote repository
  rather than keeping all your work local?
* When I'm working on a project with someone else, or with a team
* When I want to have an online backup of my project
* When I want to share the source of my project with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
  Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* Because I might haven't completed the work on a fix or a feature,
  which might make the project broke and others won't be able to launch it.
