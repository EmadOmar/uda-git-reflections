How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
* By pointing out which lines were changed.
* And by showing the old version of that line and the new line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
* Because it helps to detect bugs and unintended changes or removes, which then
  can be restored easly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
When using commits:
  * You can add a message that summarize that changes you've made

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
* Because they are targeted for programmers which are mostly make changes in
  more than a one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
* `git log` will help me know the ids of the commits
* `git diff` will help me know the differnces between two commits after passing their ids that were found using `git log`

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
* Because I can revert to the changes where that thing was working fine, and can see what
  went wrong and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
* [Nothing, I have previous little expert in Git this is why I'm not too curious]
