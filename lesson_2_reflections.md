What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* A new directory named `.git` is created in the root directory of the repository.
* So that Git can recognize the current folder as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* I can commit the files in the staging area whereas I cannot commit in files from the working directory.
* It allows me to choose the file that I think they hold a reasonable-sized logical change.
